 node_1 
       first we add all the headers that we need 
       we intialise our ros node 
       spawn the second turtle and give it name turtle 2
       creating publisher to control both of the turtles 
       using cin we ask the user to enter the name and velocity
       choose the exact pub (publisher select)
       we create a message to control the velocity that the user enter
       published for 1 second 
       then we stop the turtle chosen
       with our loop will ask again the user to enter the desired inputs
